#comment Old coders would varedit turfs to get intended behavior. This is shit because it severely handicaps code since we can't account for these.
#comment These are also really silly as varedits, because new mappers might use them unknowingly with pre-fabrications, as well as just not know that they need to use the var-edited version.
#comment This should make it drastically easier to "know" when to use such a turf as well.
