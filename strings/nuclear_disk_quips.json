		"This is a divisive matter... you wish to be outside, while I wish to remain inside.",

		"They don't have many songs about space, do they? I can't think of one.",
		"Watch out for carps!",
		"Watch out for the space pirates!",

		"I wonder if there's a bar on this shuttle. I don't do well with liquids, but you... might?",
		"It feels good to be a real thing on a real person.",
		"Nanotrasen will be pleased when they find out I've made it back safe and sound.",
		"The floor here seems a touch cleaner than what we had to deal with on the station. Floors are nice, though.",

		"Man, those turrets are a doozy. Good thing I don't get shot by them personally.",
		"Oh, that diorama in the back is actually kinda cute.",
		"That ice planet of yours fucking sucks.",
